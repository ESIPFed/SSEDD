Ensure /home/pi/DATA_STORE/ contains no old flights you no longer want or at least note the last flight number so you know what number you are starting on

To capture CO2 data do the following just before flying the drone (on the same power up)
$ ./runFirst.sh
$ python readData.py

If readData.py fails for some reason revert to using Campaign1 script: OLD_readData.py
